Use Stronghold to have your earnings paid out in US dollars.

> You won't see your payments immediately if the amount you've received is
beneath Stronghold's threshold of approximately $0.002.

## Sign up

Stronghold will assign you a payment pointer. A payment pointer is an identifier for your wallet that's safe to share with 3rd parties.

1. Go to stronghold.co and [sign up](https://identity.stronghold.co/signup) for
an account.
2. On the launchpad click **My USD Payment Pointer.** Stronghold will open a
popup displaying your payment pointer.
3. Copy your payment pointer to your clipboard.

Now you can share your payment pointer with other sites or add it to your own site by following the [Quick Start Guide](./getting-started).
