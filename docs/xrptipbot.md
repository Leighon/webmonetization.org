## Get your payment pointer

When you select the ILP deposit type you're provided a payment pointer. Copy it to your clipboard. A payment pointer is an identifier for your wallet that's safe to share with other sites. You can also add it to your own site by following the [Quick Start Guide](./getting-started).
